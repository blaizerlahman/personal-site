        My name is Blaize Lahman, I'm currently a Junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (roll badge!)
        double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science and pursuing a certificate in Economic Analytics.
        <br><br>
        I have been coding seriously since 2023, and my current programming interests include terminal apps,
        analytic and cybersecurity tools, and basically anything that can help people. 
        <br><br>
        As far as development work goes, I am an incoming Software Engineer Intern on the Dell CSG team,
        where I will work during Summer 2026. I also work for the
        Department of Computer Science here at UW where I continue to develop technical skills as 
        an undergraduate TA for CS320, an intermediate Data Programming course taught in Python.
        <br><br>
        Outside of programming I enjoy being out in nature (hiking and fishing),
        spending time with friends and family (the most important thing), and learning the guitar.
