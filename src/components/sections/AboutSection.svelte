      My name is Blaize Lahman, I'm currently a Junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (roll badge!)
      double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science and pursuing a certificate in Economic Analytics.
      <br><br>
      I have been coding seriously since 2023, and my current programming interests include terminal apps,
      analytic and cybersecurity tools, and basically anything that can help people. 
      <br><br>
      I do not develop for work currently (although I am looking and would be open to any inquiries!)
      and do so mainly to build tools for myself and others. I do however work for the
      Department of Computer Science here at UW where I continue to develop techincal skills as 
      an undergraduate TA for CS320, an intermediate Data Programming course taught in Python.
      <br><br>
      Outside of programming I enjoy being out in nature (hiking and fishing),
      spending time with friends and family (the most important thing), and learning the guitar.
